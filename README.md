# MyAppPortfolio

Welcome to my AppPortfolio.

Objective: In this app you will find constant updates about my portfolio. On this first release you will just find
dummy toast notifications explaining you what each button should perform!. But worry not, i will update it as long as 
i get better at this and finish my nano degree.

How to use it:
Download this repo to your local PC.
Make sure you have Android Studio installed.
Create a new project and import this repo.
You can already hit RUN and install in your device.

If you just want to try it, in the /app folder there is an APK named: app-release.apk feel free to install it in any android
device.

Thanks!
